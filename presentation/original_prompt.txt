I want an (Claude Code) Agent, Build Detective, that can integrate with my github account, parse projects, find CI tests that have failed, analyze them and report them back with a confidence that your assumption is correct. The intent of the agent is that it should run fast, keep the cost of expensive tokens low, Haiku model sounds appropriate. 
To avoid getting stuck in a loop of fixing the same problem in the same wrong way again and again, build a small issue tracker for seen and solved problems.
Claude code Sonnet will be responsible for running the agent, delegating tasks, ensuring QC and improving the agent. Use Git for version control.
Generate the .md documents and code outlines so Claude Code/LLM knows how to structure
