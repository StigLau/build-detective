# Build Detective Quality Assurance System

## The Trust But Verify Problem

**Challenge**: How does Sonnet know when Build Detective analysis is wrong and needs manual intervention?

**Core Issue**: Haiku excels at pattern matching but can miss edge cases, provide overconfident responses, or misclassify complex scenarios.

**Solution**: Multi-layered quality assurance with **automatic escalation triggers** and **pattern learning feedback loops**.

## Sonnet Oversight Responsibilities

### **Primary Role: Quality Validator**
Sonnet acts as **senior consultant** reviewing BD's **junior analyst** work:

```
Build Detective: "Found exact pattern match, confidence 9/10"
Sonnet: "Hold on - let me verify this makes sense..."
```

### **When Sonnet MUST Reevaluate BD**

#### 1. **Confidence Score Red Flags** üö®
```markdown
IF confidence < 7:
  ‚Üí Sonnet must manually review the analysis
  ‚Üí BD is uncertain, human-level reasoning needed

IF confidence = 10:
  ‚Üí Sonnet should verify - perfect confidence is suspicious
  ‚Üí Real CI failures are rarely textbook perfect
```

#### 2. **Context Contradiction Triggers** ‚ö†Ô∏è
```markdown
BD says: "Java compilation error"
Context: This is a Python-only project
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD misunderstood the technology stack

BD says: "Maven plugin failure" 
Context: No pom.xml files in repository
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD applied wrong pattern library

BD says: "Simple dependency issue"
Context: Multiple complex failures in same log
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD oversimplified complex scenario
```

#### 3. **Solution Feasibility Checks** üîç
```markdown
BD suggests: "Update Java version to 21"
Reality: Project requires Java 8 for legacy compatibility
‚Üí ESCALATE: Solution conflicts with project constraints

BD suggests: "Add missing dependency X"
Reality: Dependency X was recently removed intentionally  
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD doesn't understand project history

BD suggests: "Fix Maven configuration"
Reality: This is the 5th identical failure in 2 days
‚Üí ESCALATE: Systemic issue, not configuration problem
```

#### 4. **Pattern Mismatch Indicators** üß©
```markdown
BD error_type: "compilation"
Log contains: Docker, Kubernetes, deployment errors
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD focused on wrong error section

BD primary_error: "Test failure in TestA.methodB"  
Log reality: Build never reached test phase
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD misidentified build phase

BD suggested_action: Very generic ("check configuration")
‚Üí ESCALATE: BD didn't find specific pattern, guessing
```

## Automatic Quality Assurance Triggers

### **Level 1: Instant Validation** (Sonnet Implementation)
```python
def validate_bd_analysis(bd_result: dict, context: dict) -> ValidationResult:
    """Automatic validation checks Sonnet runs on every BD analysis"""
    
    issues = []
    
    # Confidence sanity check
    if bd_result["confidence"] < 7:
        issues.append("LOW_CONFIDENCE: Manual review required")
    
    if bd_result["confidence"] == 10:
        issues.append("PERFECT_CONFIDENCE: Suspicious, verify accuracy")
    
    # Technology stack alignment
    if bd_result["error_type"] == "java_version" and not context.has_java_files():
        issues.append("TECH_MISMATCH: Java error in non-Java project")
    
    # Solution specificity check
    if "check configuration" in bd_result["suggested_action"].lower():
        issues.append("GENERIC_SOLUTION: BD didn't find specific pattern")
    
    # Build phase logic
    if bd_result["build_step"] == "test" and "BUILD FAILURE" in context.raw_log:
        issues.append("PHASE_MISMATCH: Test failure claimed but build failed")
    
    return ValidationResult(
        needs_manual_review=len(issues) > 0,
        validation_issues=issues,
        escalation_required=any("MISMATCH" in issue for issue in issues)
    )
```

### **Level 2: Human Feedback Integration** üîÑ
```markdown
## BD Analysis Feedback System

After each BD analysis, user can provide feedback:

‚úÖ "BD was correct - solution worked"
   ‚Üí Increase pattern confidence, add to success examples

‚ùå "BD was wrong - solution didn't work"  
   ‚Üí Decrease pattern confidence, flag for review

ü§î "BD was partially correct but missed key details"
   ‚Üí Add complexity flags to pattern, suggest Sonnet review for similar cases

üí° "BD missed the real issue entirely"
   ‚Üí Add anti-pattern to prevent similar misclassification
```

### **Level 3: Pattern Learning and Evolution** üß†
```markdown
## Pattern Quality Tracking

Each BD pattern maintains:

pattern_accuracy: 0.87  # 87% success rate based on user feedback
pattern_complexity: "high"  # Complex scenarios need Sonnet review
last_false_positive: "2024-01-15"  # When pattern last gave wrong answer
escalation_triggers: ["multi_module", "gradle_kotlin"]  # Auto-escalate contexts

Pattern Degradation:
IF pattern_accuracy < 0.8:
  ‚Üí Auto-escalate similar cases to Sonnet
  ‚Üí Flag pattern for expert review and improvement
```

## Sonnet Escalation Decision Tree

### **Step 1: Quick Validation** (30 seconds)
```markdown
1. Check BD confidence score vs complexity indicators
2. Verify technology stack alignment  
3. Scan for obvious context contradictions
4. Assess solution specificity and feasibility

IF any red flags ‚Üí ESCALATE to Step 2
ELSE ‚Üí Accept BD analysis with monitoring
```

### **Step 2: Deep Analysis** (2-3 minutes)
```markdown
1. Read full log context BD analyzed
2. Cross-reference with project history/constraints
3. Verify BD's error classification and build phase identification
4. Test BD's suggested solution against project realities

IF BD analysis fundamentally flawed ‚Üí Override with Sonnet analysis
IF BD missed complexity ‚Üí Augment BD analysis with additional context
IF BD mostly correct ‚Üí Endorse with minor corrections
```

### **Step 3: Pattern Improvement** (5+ minutes)
```markdown
1. Document what BD got wrong and why
2. Identify if this is pattern deficiency or edge case
3. Update BD pattern library with lessons learned
4. Add escalation triggers for similar future scenarios
```

## Implementation in CLAUDE.md

### **Build Detective Integration Pattern**
```markdown
### Subagent Delegation Strategy
**CRITICAL**: Use Build Detective with Sonnet oversight:

1. **Delegate to build-detective** for CI failures, build errors
2. **Sonnet validates** BD analysis using quality checks
3. **Escalate to manual** if BD confidence < 7 or context mismatch detected
4. **Document lessons** learned for BD pattern improvement

### Build Detective Quality Checklist
Before accepting BD analysis, verify:
- [ ] BD confidence aligns with error complexity
- [ ] Technology stack matches project reality  
- [ ] Suggested solution is project-feasible
- [ ] Error classification matches actual build phase
- [ ] No obvious context contradictions present
```

## Continuous Improvement Loop

### **Weekly BD Performance Review** üìà
```markdown
1. Analyze BD success/failure rates from user feedback
2. Identify patterns that need improvement or retirement
3. Update escalation triggers based on false positive patterns
4. Add new patterns for error types BD is missing
5. Adjust confidence scoring for patterns showing drift
```

### **Monthly Pattern Library Audit** üîç
```markdown
1. Review patterns with accuracy < 85%
2. Retire patterns that consistently mislead
3. Promote experimental patterns that show high accuracy
4. Cross-reference BD patterns with industry best practices
5. Document BD limitations and recommended escalation scenarios
```

### **Feedback Integration Workflow** üîÑ
```markdown
User reports BD was wrong:
1. Sonnet analyzes what BD missed
2. Determine if pattern improvement or escalation trigger needed
3. Update BD pattern library with lessons learned
4. Test updated patterns against historical failures
5. Deploy improved BD template to all projects
```

## Success Metrics

### **Quality Indicators** ‚úÖ
- **BD Accuracy Rate**: Target >90% for patterns with confidence >8
- **False Positive Rate**: <5% on high-confidence analyses  
- **Escalation Precision**: Sonnet correctly identifies when BD is wrong >95% of time
- **Time to Resolution**: BD analysis + Sonnet validation <2 minutes average

### **Trust Indicators** ü§ù
- **User Satisfaction**: Developers trust BD recommendations >90% of time
- **Adoption Rate**: BD analysis accepted without manual review >80% of cases
